    "# PCAM Extraction Notebook - Quick Start Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "This Colab notebook is designed to extract the preprocessed PCAM dataset after it has been zipped (from Preprocessing_PCAM.ipynb) and uploaded to Google Drive. The notebook first mounts your Google Drive to access files, then unzips the dataset to either local Colab storage (fast but temporary) or back to Google Drive (slower but persistent).\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this notebook with any ZIP file, simply modify the `zip_path` variable to point to your ZIP file location in Google Drive, and adjust the `extract_path` to your desired extraction location. The `EXTRACT_TO_LOCAL` flag controls whether data is extracted to temporary Colab storage (deleted after session) or to Google Drive (permanent)—set it to `False` for Drive extraction or `True` for faster local extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workflow is particularly useful when you've preprocessed a large dataset locally (using the Preprocessing_PCAM script), zipped the results to save space, uploaded to Google Drive for cloud access, and now need to extract it in Colab for model training or analysis."
